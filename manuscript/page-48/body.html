During an eruption at night on September 17, a spectacular display of lightning and incandescent ballistics and pyroclastic flows were witnessed by hunters who camped about 18 kilometers to the southeast; a faint glow above Crater Peak was also visible from as far away as Anchorage.</p><p>[Illustration: Steaming Crater Peak, a satellite vent on the south side of Mount Spurr volcano, produced three explosive eruptions in 1992.
