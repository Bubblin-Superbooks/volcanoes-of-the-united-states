Although most caldera unrest does not lead to an eruption, the possibility of violent explosive eruptions warrants detailed scientific study and monitoring of some active calderas.</p><p>Recently, scientists have recognized volcanic unrest at two calderas in the United States, Long Valley Caldera in eastern California and Yellowstone Caldera in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Whether unrest at these calderas simply punctuates long periods of quiet or is the early warning sign of future eruptions is an important but still unanswered question.</p><p>[Illustration: Yellowstone River plummets through the famous Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. Carved by the river, the “yellow” rocks of the canyon are rhyolite lava flows that have been altered by hot water. The lava flows were erupted after the most recent caldera-forming eruption about 600,000 years ago.]</p></div> </div>
