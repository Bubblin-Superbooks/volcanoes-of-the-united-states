The volcanoes stretch 2,500 km across the north Pacific Ocean and become progressively older to the northwest. Formed initially above a relatively stationary “hot spot” in the Earth’s interior, each volcano was rafted away from the hot spot as the Pacific Plate moves northwestward at about 9 cm per year. The island of Hawaii consists of the youngest volcanoes in the chain and is currently located over the hot spot.]</p><p>HAWAII NIIHAU KAUAI OAHU MOLOKAI LANAI MAUI KAHOOLAWE PACIFIC PLATE Oceanic Crust Fixed “Hot Spot” Zone of magma formation extends to Kilauea & Mauna Loa Direction of place movement</p></div> </div>
