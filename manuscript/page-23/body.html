The geologic record shows that such large-volume eruptions from the rift zones and the summit area, covering large parts of Kilauea’s surface, have occurred many times in the recent past. In fact, about 90 percent of Kilauea’s surface is covered with lava flows that are less than 1,100 years old.</p><p>[Illustration: The volcanic cone of Pu’u O’o, named after an extinct Hawaiian bird, towers above an active lava lake (background).
