Most of the domes were destroyed by explosions or collapsed down the volcano’s north flank. Some of these events triggered small pyroclastic flows that melted snow and ice on the volcano to form lahars in Drift River Valley, which empties into Cook Inlet 35 kilometers away.</p><p>Ash produced by the eruptions severely affected air traffic enroute to Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city and a major hub of domestic and international commercial air traffic. Many domestic carriers suspended service to Alaska following major explosive events, and several international carriers temporarily rerouted flights around Alaska. On December 15, a jetliner enroute to Japan encountered an ash cloud while descending into Anchorage.</p></div> </div>
