After eight months of earthquake activity beneath the volcano, a violent explosion began on March 26. Billowing ash plumes rose more than 10 kilometers above the vent, pyroclastic flows sped down the volcano’s flanks into the sea, and ash spread throughout Cook Inlet. A second stage began April 23, when lava began erupting near the volcano’s summit and added about 25 meters to the top of the existing lava dome. Small pyroclastic flows accompanied growth of the dome.</p><p>Scientists were worried that this eruption might trigger a giant landslide from Augustine’s steep upper cone, which could enter the sea to create a tsunami (powerful seismic sea wave). At least 12 landslides are known to have occurred at Augustine.</p></div> </div>
