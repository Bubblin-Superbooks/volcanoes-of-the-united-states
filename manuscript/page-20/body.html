It has erupted 15 times since 1900, with eruptions lasting from less than 1 day to as many as 145 days.</p><p>The most recent eruption began before dawn on March 25, 1984. Brilliant lava fountains lit the night-time sky as fissures opened across the floor of the caldera. Within hours, the summit activity stopped and lava began erupting from a series of vents along the northeast rift zone. When the eruption stopped 3 weeks later, lava flows were only 6.</p></div> </div>
