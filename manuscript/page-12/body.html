During the past 10 years, several warnings of eruptions were issued by the USGS and monitoring of recently active volcanoes in the United States was expanded. Predicting the time and size of volcanic eruptions, however, remains a difficult challenge for scientists.</p><p>[Illustration: Scientist collects lava sample from lava flow entering the sea on Kilauea Volcano.
