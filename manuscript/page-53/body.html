The spectacular geysers, boiling hot springs, and mud pots that have made Yellowstone famous—and even the strikingly beautiful Grand Canyon of Yellowstone through which the Yellowstone River plunges—owe their existence to the tremendous volcanic forces that have affected the region during the past 2 million years. Cataclysmic eruptions 2.0, 1.3, and 0.6 million years ago ejected huge volumes of rhyolite magma;</p></div> </div>
