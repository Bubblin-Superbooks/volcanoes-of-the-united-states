In 1916, the deposits were still hot enough to boil water and form countless steaming fumaroles; hence the expedition named this part of the Ukak River the “Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes.”</p><p>Trident Volcano.</p><p>Eruptions of andesitic lava flows between 1953 and 1960 built a new cone on Trident’s southwest flank, adding yet another to the volcano’s older complex of three overlapping cones (hence the name Trident). A huge cloud of rising ash was seen on February 15, 1953, in the direction of Katmai National Monument; 3 days later clear weather permitted U.S. Navy pilots to spot a blocky lava flow emerging from Trident’s southwest flank. Slow extrusion of lava during the next 4 months built an irregularly shaped lava dome about 1.5 kilometers long and 600 meters tall.</p></div> </div>
