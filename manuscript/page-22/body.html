Instead of regular episodes of high lava fountaining, lava spilled continuously onto Kilauea’s surface. The steady outpouring of lava formed a lake of molten rock that became perched atop a small shield volcano. By June 1991, the shield was about 60 meters tall and 1,600 meters in diameter, and lava from the eruption had covered 75 square kilometers of forest and grassland, added 120 hectares of new land to the island, and destroyed 179 homes.</p><p>[Illustration: Aerial view of Hawaii’s two most active volcanoes, Kilauea and Mauna Loa.
