<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Young volcanoes, lava flows, and hot springs were discovered in a broad valley less than 8 km wide along the crest of the ridge in the 1970’s. The ocean floor is spreading apart and forming new ocean crust along this valley or “rift” as hot magma from the Earth’s interior is injected into the ridge and erupted at its top.</p><p>In the Pacific Northwest, the Juan de Fuca Plate plunges beneath the North American Plate. As the denser plate of oceanic crust is forced deep into the Earth’s interior beneath the continental plate, a process known as subduction, it encounters high temperatures and pressures that partially melt solid rock. Some of this newly formed magma rises toward the Earth’s surface to erupt, forming a chain of volcanoes above the subduction zone.]</p></div> </div>
