Their frequent but usually non-explosive eruptions make them ideal for scientific study. Kilauea’s eruptions are so intensely monitored that scientists have assembled a detailed picture of the volcano’s magma reservoir “plumbing” system and how it behaves before and during eruptions. Studies of these volcanoes and the surrounding ocean floor continue to improve our understanding of the geologic history of the Hawaiian Island chain and the ability of scientists to determine volcanic hazards that threaten island residents.</p><p>[Illustration: Hawaiian Volcanoes]</p></div> </div>
