<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When magma reaches the surface, it is called lava. Phreatic A type of volcanic explosion that occurs when eruption water comes in contact with hot rocks or ash near a volcanic vent, causing steam explosions. Pumice A light-colored volcanic rock containing abundant trapped gas bubbles formed by the explosive eruption of magma. Because of its numerous gas bubbles, pumice commonly floats on water. Pyroclastic flow A hot, fast-moving and high-density mixture of ash, pumice, rock fragments, and gas formed during explosive eruptions. Pyroclastic Same process as pyroclastic flow but of much surge lower density. Rhyolite A volcanic rock containing more than 68% silica with a very high viscosity when in a molten state. Shield volcano A volcano shaped like an inverted warriorâ€™s shield with long gentle slopes produced by eruptions of low-viscosity basaltic lava.</p></div> </div>
