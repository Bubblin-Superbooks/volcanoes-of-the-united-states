Swarms of earthquakes beneath the caldera, changes in several hot springs, and the formation of new springs have occurred since 1980. Precise surveys have also shown that the central part of the caldera has risen by more than 50 centimeters since 1975. This unrest is probably related to the stretching (east-west extension) of the Earth’s crust that is known to be occurring in the region around the caldera, and it probably also involves the rise of magma beneath the caldera.</p></div> </div>
