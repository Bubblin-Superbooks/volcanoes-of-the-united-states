Mount Rainier has 26 glaciers containing more than five times as much snow and ice as all the other Cascade volcanoes combined. If only a small part of this ice were melted by volcanic activity, it would yield enough water to trigger enormous lahars.</p><p>Mount Rainier’s potential for generating destructive mudflows is enhanced by its great height above surrounding valleys and its “soft” interior. The volcano stands about 3,000 meters above river valleys leading from its base.</p></div> </div>
