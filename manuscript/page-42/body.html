Within one hour, a tsunami as high as 9 meters crashed ashore on the coast of the Kenai Peninsula 80 kilometers away. No one was killed and property damage was only minor because the tsunami hit at low tide. Subsequent eruptions have rebuilt a steep cone of overlapping lava domes similar to the cone that existed just before the 1883 landslide.</p><p>[Illustration: Pyroclastic flow descending the upper flanks of Augustine Volcano.

An estimated 15 cubic kilometers of magma was explosively erupted during 60 hours beginning on June 6—about 30 times the volume erupted by Mount St. Helens in 1980!</p></div> </div>
